# Using the google maps API to get UK university and college addresses

A work in progress python 3 script to retrieve the postcodes of UK colleges and universities using their names.

Original names of institutions from here: https://www.hesa.ac.uk/dox/unistats/UNISTATS_UKPRN_lookup_20141030.xls 

Manually cleaned a bit to create the csv file in this repo (not very reproducible, but I was too short on time to engage with regex...)
